# Hello-World
This is me trying to understand this stuff
I think from inside me, the loudest thing about myself is my imposter syndrome. 
I hear, "liar", "liar", "fake", "don't let them think that", "can you really..."
Coming in as a close second is my self-doubt
it hovers over me 
and hinders everything
but surely, I am better than that
Everybody is
